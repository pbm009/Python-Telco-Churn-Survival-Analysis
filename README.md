# Python-Telco-Churn-Survival-Analysis

This is an individual project that I did for a BANA class at SHSU.
I used the lifelines library to perform a survival analysis on the telco customer churn dataset.
This dataset can be easily found and is available from Kaggle and IBM's business analytics community website.
